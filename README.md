Ladybug Run
=============================== 

## Description

This is based off of an old arcade game called Frogger. This is the 3rd project for my Udacity Front-end Nano-Degree. This game is created with Object Oriented JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and the class.js file is written in ES6.

The point of the game is to get as many ladybugs to the water before time runs out. Don't let the bugs touch you or you will have to start over.

I enjoyed making this game and I hope you enjoy playing it.

### How to play

To play this game please visit http://ladybugrun.surge.sh/.

1.  Use the arrow keys to move the ladybug safely to water.
2.  Try to get as many ladybugs to the water before the time runs out.
3.  Beware of the bugs!:
    - If they catch you all the ladybugs get taken away.
4.  Play Again and share.

### Contributing

Udacity provided the starter code which included the HTML5 Canvas (resource.js and engine.js) and most of the images.
The Udacity [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) has a list of all the minimium requirements to complete the project.

I refrenced this [Udacity HTML5 Canvas Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/html5-canvas--ud292) for adding the images (Player and Enemy) and to change the player character after every turn.

I also received a lot of pointers from [FEND Arcade Game Project - Getting Started](https://zoom.us/recording/play/aulotDlzKFegQFIJTaTzKgWvNkVsYtlwO454vL1UPE1Cm6lOUBQCtfVurPOIAGAS?startTime=1529542978000). I was given a lot of code that I used within the game and it helped me get started on this project.

I also received help on several occasions from my fantastic peers who are taking
this Udacity Nano-Degree alongside me.

### Future Updates

- Mobile responsiveness.
- Mouse and touch compatibility.
- Stones to randomly block bugs after scores.

#### Have Fun!
